# Lancerpoint

#### Pasadena City College Lancerpoint Portal Android Application
  This was created as a project to help students access their student accounts at Pasadena City College through their Android phones. Once upon a time it was completely functional, however as this was made with the intention to employ sockets, web scraping and other basic concepts, it is likely that Pasadena City College has changed how Lancerpoint works.
